# Deep Convolutional Q-Learning for Pac-Man

This repository contains the implementation of a Deep Reinforcement Learning model for playing Pac-Man using Deep Convolutional Q-Learning. The project is designed to demonstrate how convolutional neural networks can be applied in a reinforcement learning framework to solve complex problems in gaming environments.

## Features
- Implementation of Deep Q-Learning algorithm with a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture.
- Training the model to play Pac-Man using reinforcement learning.
- Structured code and modular implementation to facilitate understanding and experimentation.
- Educational resource designed for learners to grasp the fundamentals of Deep Reinforcement Learning.
- Visualization of training progress, including rewards and loss curves.
- Support for customizable hyperparameters to fine-tune model performance.
- Compatibility with various Pac-Man environments, enabling experimentation with different game dynamics.
- Checkpointing system to save and resume training progress.

## Contents
The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook, containing the following:
- **Introduction**: Overview of the problem and methodology.
